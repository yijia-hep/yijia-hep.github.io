I am interested in the intersection of particle physics and astrophysics. 

Currently, I am an Associate Professor at the [Institute of High Energy Physics](http://english.ihep.cas.cn/) (IHEP), working on the [Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory](https://juno.ihep.cas.cn/) (JUNO). I work on the precision measurements of oscillation parameters with reactor neutrinos, development of
a supernova early warning system, and the first detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background.
 
Previously, I was a key member of [Professor Samuel Ting'group at MIT](https://web.mit.edu/lns/research/emi.html) and worked on the [Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer](https://ams02.space/) (AMS) aboard the International Space Station.
